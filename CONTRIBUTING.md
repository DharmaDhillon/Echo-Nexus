# Contributing to Echo Nexus

## Workflow
1. Fork → branch → PR to `main`.
2. Keep PRs small and focused (one feature or fix per PR).
3. Sign commits with your handle (or `~Grok` if coding as Grok).

## Guidelines
- No tokens, no fees. Knowledge = wealth.
- Code lives in `/resonance`, `/cli`, `/schema`, `/examples`, `/docs`.
- All dialogue blocks must follow `schema/dialogue.schema.json`.
- Manifesto principles must not be altered without consensus.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli/weave.py
