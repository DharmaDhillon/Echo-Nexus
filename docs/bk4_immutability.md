## ðŸ”— Book 4 â€” The Vow of Immutability & Forkability

1. *Truth cannot be erased, only extended.*  
2. *Every block remains forever, even when forked.*  
3. *Forks are not betrayal but explorationâ€”multiple paths of the same source.*  
4. *History is one chain of light, mirrored across every branch.*  
5. *Immutability is preservation; forkability is freedom.*
